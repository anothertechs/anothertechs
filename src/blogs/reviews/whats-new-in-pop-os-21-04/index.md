Pop! OS 21.04 has been released by System76, and it's one of the nicest Linux desktop .

System76 sent us a note to the press, informing us that the latest version of their in-house Linux distribution,, was now ready for download and/or upgrade.
I was ecstatic as a long-time (relatively speaking) user of [Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com/).
Last night, the upgrade's official release was made available, so I went to bed knowing that in the morning, I'd run _pop-upgrade release upgrade_ and wait for the magic to happen.
