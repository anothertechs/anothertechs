# Candlestick Pattern - Morning star

For a long time, investors have been carefully studying the candlestick patterns that appear in the price trajectory. This is to predict the future. These areconsidered price signals in technical analysis.A fascinating set of **reversal** pattern analysis are those that indicate stars. A star is composed of a small real body (green/red or white/black), which separates the large real body before it. In other words, the actual body of the star may be within the upper shadow line of the previous trading day; all that is required is that the candles do not overlap.

## What does morning star analysis tells us?

The morning star's small real body represent a stalement between the bulls and bear. The bear are obviously in charge in a brisky descending market(crypto,stock,foreing exchange). With the emergence of a morning star in such an environment,it is a signal of a shift from the **seller being in control to a deadlock between the selling and buying forces**.This dealock may have occured either because of a diminution in the selling forces or an increase in the buying pressure. Either way, the morning star analysis tells us the rally's prior power has slightly dissipated. This means the market will move upwards.

In this combination, the support area is considered to be retained. If there is a morning star pattern, the price is likely to rebound. You can enable a high security UP option.

**Conditions**: a 5-minute candlestick price chart, a support zone, and an expiration time of 15 minutes or more.

When the price falls into the support zone and forms a morning star candlestick pattern, turn on the UP option.

### 2. Combining with RSI indicator

### Notes

- Don't use morning star candlestick pattern just to find a trade. Combine it with at least one indicator or other price signal to get a higher probability of winning.
- Restrict the use of morning star mode when the market deviates. Because the accuracy of this candlestick pattern in the side market is not high.

## Limitation of Morning Star Pattern

Limitation of Morning star pattern is that since this is a three-candle pattern, you must wait until the end of the third trading candle to complete the pattern. Normally, if this third candle is a tall white or green candle, we will get a good signal after the market has rallied sharply. In other words, the termination of morning star pattern may not provide attractive risk / reward trading opportunities. One option is to wait for the morning star support area correction and start eating the bulls.

Although the ideal morning star and [evening star](https://anothertechs.com/crypto/evening-star/) should not allow any of their three entities to touch, but in a market where the opening and closing prices are the same or the closing price is the same, the definition of the morning star (and the [evening star](https://anothertechs.com/crypto/evening-star/)) is more flexible.
